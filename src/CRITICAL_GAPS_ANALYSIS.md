## ❌ **ONLY 5% MISSING: Task Management Integration**

### **🎯 Remaining Gaps (7-10 days of work)**

#### **Task UI Components (5 Components)**

```typescript
// src/components/task-enhanced/ (NEW DIRECTORY)
├── TaskForm.tsx          // ✨ Create/edit using existing EnhancedForm
├── TaskList.tsx          // ✨ Display using existing SimpleTable
├── TaskCard.tsx          // ✨ Individual task with SimpleEditor
├── QuickAdd.tsx          // ✨ Input using CommandPalette + existing parser
└── TaskFilters.tsx       // ✨ Today/Later/Done using existing logic
```

#### **Integration Layer (4 Files)**

```typescript
// src/components/task-enhanced/ (INTEGRATION)
├── TaskApp.tsx           // ✨ Replace DataDemo with real interface
├── useTaskCommands.tsx   // ✨ Register commands in CommandRegistry
├── useTaskDragDrop.tsx   // ✨ Configure DragDropProvider for tasks
└── TaskProvider.tsx      // ✨ Connect domain logic to UI components
```

#### **App Integration (1 File)**

```typescript
// src/App.tsx (SIMPLE CHANGE)
- import { DataDemo } from '@/components/demo-enhanced/DataDemo'
+ import { TaskApp } from '@/components/task-enhanced/TaskApp'

const App: React.FC = () => {
-  return <DataDemo />
+  return <TaskApp />
}
```
