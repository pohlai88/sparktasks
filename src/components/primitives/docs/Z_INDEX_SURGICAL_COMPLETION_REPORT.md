# ✅ Z-Index Orchestrator Surgical Patch - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

All linting and TypeScript errors in the Z-Index Orchestrator documentation have been resolved, and the surgical improvements are fully functional.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Documentation File (`z-index-orchestrator-usage.tsx`) ✅

- ❌ `Cannot find name 'YourComponents'` → ✅ Defined proper component
- ❌ `'layer' is assigned but never used` → ✅ Removed unused destructuring
- ❌ `Do not use "require"` → ✅ Used proper ES6 imports
- ❌ `Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'` → ✅ Added `String()` conversion
- ❌ `Parameter 'conflict' implicitly has an 'any' type` → ✅ Added proper typing
- ❌ `'React' is declared but never used` → ✅ Cleaned up unused imports

### 2. File Organization ✅

- Moved documentation from `src/components/primitives/docs/` to `docs/` folder
- Better separation of concerns (docs vs code)

### 3. Surgical Improvements Validated ✅

- **Test Suite**: 21/21 tests passing ✅
- **Token Hierarchy**: modal (1300) > popover (1100) ✅
- **Provider Pattern**: Context-based orchestrator ✅
- **Tokenic Classes**: z-modal, z-popover, z-toast, z-tooltip ✅
- **Tailwind Integration**: Theme extension active ✅
