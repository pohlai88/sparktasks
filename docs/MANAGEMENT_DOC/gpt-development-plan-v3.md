# 🛡 DRIFT-SAFE — SparkTasks GPT Development Plan (SSOT v3)

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for prompts, guardrails, phase gates, and competitive-grade delivery.
**Rule #1**: If a change needs >\~220 diff lines or leaves allowed paths → **stop and ask ONE question** (no drift).

## Universal Anti-Drift Header (prepend to every task)

**DRIFT-SAFE CODING INSTRUCTION — SparkTasks**

* Apply only the explicit change. If completion requires leaving allowed paths or >\~220 diff lines, stop and return ONE clarifying question.
* **Output**: unified git diff only (no prose/logs).
* **Rules**: surgical patch; preserve unaffected lines; don't change public APIs/flags/error codes/schema/budgets/deps; never touch CI or security/E2EE without explicit approval; no new deps/lockfile churn.
* **DoD (ALL)**: type-check/test/build pass; eslint+prettier clean (touched files); perf budgets respected; UI tasks must validate focus/ARIA/keyboard.

# Phase A — "Make It Work" (Weeks 1–4) **[COMPETITIVE EDGE FOCUS]**

**Objective**: Build functional task management UI that rivals existing solutions. **Critical Gap**: Backend is 100% complete but no usable interface exists.
**Competitive Benchmark**: Match Linear's speed + Todoist's UX + Trello's simplicity + exceed on accessibility.

### A1 — Basic Task UI + Forms (**PARTIALLY COMPLETE - NEEDS EDITING**)

**STATUS**: � **MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL** - 13/14 tests passing, competitive UX foundation in place
**Test Results**: Task creation, viewing, completion working well; missing task editing UI and delete wiring
**Evidence**: Strong form validation, focus management, optimistic updates - but edit functionality gap

**Allowed**: `src/components/**`, `src/stores/**` (connect only, no changes), `src/App.tsx`, `tests/**`
**Forbidden**: SSOT/docs/configs/deps/backend/crypto changes
**Prompt**: **COMPLETE A1 TASK EDITING** - add inline/modal task editing, wire delete properly, finish DoD

**Core Requirements** (STATUS):
- ✅ Task creation form with title/description/priority/tags (working well)
- ✅ Task list rendering from store with Today/Later/Done columns (solid implementation)
- ✅ Complete/uncomplete buttons that update task status (working with proper state)  
- ❌ Edit task inline or modal functionality (MISSING - critical gap)
- ❌ Delete task capability (exists but not properly wired to UI)
- ✅ Wire all actions to existing taskStore methods (mostly complete)

**CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED**:
- **Task Editing UI**: Add inline edit mode or modal for task editing with title/notes/tags
- **Delete Integration**: Ensure delete buttons properly trigger soft delete (ARCHIVED status)
- **Form Enhancement**: Complete any missing validation edge cases

**Competitive Edge Enhancements** (WORKING):
- ✅ Form validation via existing Zod schemas with inline errors
- ✅ Optimistic updates + rollback toast for snappy feel  
- ✅ Focus management: new task title focus, modal close returns focus
- ✅ Analytics hooks: track "time-to-first-task" for A5 baseline
- ✅ Quick-Add hints ("tomorrow 4pm #work") below title field
- ✅ Empty state scaffolding with example tasks and "Get Started" flow

**DoD Progress**: 8/8 complete - **A1 FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### A2 — Task Interactions + State Updates (**COMPLETE WITH SSOT EXCELLENCE**)

**STATUS**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - 7/7 SSOT tests passing, all interactions working perfectly

- ✅ **Undo/Redo Integration**: Working with specific button selectors (no conflicts)

**DoD**: ✅ All 7 SSOT tests passing; keyboard navigation working; ARIA compliant; reliable task movements

### A3 — Keyboard Navigation + A11y (**COMPLETE WITH SSOT EXCELLENCE**)

**STATUS**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - 6/6 SSOT tests passing, accessibility features fully operational
**Test Results**: All accessibility features working with SSOT architecture compliance
**Evidence**: Focus management, keyboard navigation, reduced motion support, ARIA compliance verified

**ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED**:
- ✅ **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and proper focus restoration working
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab/Shift+Tab navigation functional within task lists
- ✅ **ARIA Compliance**: Form labels, error handling, live regions operational
- ✅ **Reduced Motion**: Proper animation respect for accessibility preferences
- ✅ **SSOT Migration**: Successfully migrated from legacy selectors to SSOT architecture
- ✅ **Button Conflicts**: All accessibility tests now use conflict-free SSOT selectors

**DoD**: ✅ WCAG AA compliance achieved; accessibility tests passing; screen reader compatibility verified; keyboard navigation operational

### A4 — Search UI + Quick-Add Interface (**COMPLETE WITH SSOT EXCELLENCE**)

**STATUS**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - 12/12 SSOT tests passing, search and quick-add operational
**Test Results**: All search functionality and quick-add features working perfectly
**Evidence**: Debounced search, ARIA listbox, keyboard navigation, live announcements verified

**GOAL**: Build search input UI and a quick-add input wired to the EXISTING search engine and quick-add parser. No domain logic changes; UI only.

**ALLOWED**: `src/components/**` (new/edits), `src/App.tsx`, `index.css` (styling only), `test/**`
**FORBIDDEN**: SSOT/docs/configs/deps/backend/crypto changes; Any change to search ranking/algorithms or quick-add parser rules; New dependencies or store shape/enum changes; Persistence for "recent searches" beyond in-memory (unless pre-existing)

**IMMUTABLE CONSTRAINTS**:
- Treat search + quick-add as black boxes: pass inputs, render outputs
- Preserve A1–A3 behaviors (a11y, keyboard, live announcements, ARCHIVED semantics)
- Keep selectors role/label-based; listbox must be ARIA-compliant

**SEMANTICS (MUST)**:
- **Search bar**: Debounced input (150–250ms); Results shown in an ARIA listbox (role="listbox"); items are role="option"; Active option set via aria-activedescendant; ↑/↓ moves, Enter selects, Esc closes listbox (query remains); Visual highlight of matched substrings done client-side (no backend changes)
- **Quick-Add**: Single-line input with ghost examples (e.g., "tomorrow 4pm #ops"); On Enter: call existing parser → create via store; show toast + live-region announcement; Inline validation errors with aria-describedby + role="alert"
- **Optional scopes (ONLY IF ALREADY SUPPORTED BY ENGINE)**: Status (Today/Later/Done), tags, dates. UI simply passes supported params through; no new filtering logic
- **Empty states**: "No results" message exposed via role="status"

**A11Y & KEYBOARD (MUST)**:
- Search input has a label; Listbox/options follow ARIA pattern; focus returns to the search input when listbox closes
- Quick-Add labeled; errors announced in live region
- Keyboard map: ↑/↓ navigate, Enter select, Esc closes listbox, Tab/Shift+Tab move focus predictably

**VISUAL & PERFORMANCE**:
- Debounce search; avoid jank during typing
- Use `<mark>` or data attributes for highlights (avoid dynamic Tailwind class names)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion for result transitions

**COMPETITIVE ENHANCEMENTS (STRETCH — ONLY IF ZERO NEW DEPS & NO STORE CHANGES)**:
- **Slash commands** (`/today`, `/urgent`) [only if already parsed upstream]
- **Recent searches** (in-memory only; reset on reload)
- **Fuzzy matching** (only if engine already supports)
- **Export results** (only if existing export util is present)
- **Search analytics** (only if telemetry hook already exists)
> **Any enhancement needing new deps, parser changes, or persistence → DEFER**

**DEFINITION OF DONE**:
- Users can search with live results and select via keyboard/mouse
- Users can quick-add tasks via the existing parser; task appears in the correct lane
- ARIA listbox fully operable; errors visible and announced
- All A1–A3 tests remain green; new A4 tests pass on Chromium/WebKit/Firefox

**SUBMISSION CHECKLIST (BLOCKERS IF ANY FAIL)**:
- [ ] Only allowed files changed; no deps/config/store diffs
- [ ] Listbox ARIA complete (listbox/options + active option)
- [ ] Quick-Add wired to existing parser; success + error announcements
- [ ] Esc closes listbox but preserves query
- [ ] Debounce applied; no typing jank
- [ ] Tests green on Chromium/WebKit/Firefox
- [ ] A1–A3 behaviors unchanged (ARCHIVED excluded; keyboard/menu canonical)

**IF UNCERTAIN**: If wiring requires parser or engine changes: STOP and escalate with a one-paragraph note.

### A5 — Performance Baseline + Mobile Responsive (**FUTURE-PROOFING**)

**Prompt**: Add Web Vitals monitoring; ensure 3-column layout adapts to mobile; optimize bundle <250KB.

**Core Implementation**:
- **Web Vitals Hook**: Console logging in dev; in-memory buffer in prod (exportable for bug reports)
