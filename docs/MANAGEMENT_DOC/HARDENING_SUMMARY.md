# 🔧 Surgical Hardening Features - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Two Critical Data Integrity Checks

### 🕒 **Monotonic Timestamp Validation**

**Problem:** Events with timestamps earlier than previous events for the same task can confuse reducers and create "time-travel" inconsistencies.

**Solution:**

- **Detection**: Check each event timestamp against the last known timestamp for that task ID
- **Sources**: Compares against existing task `updatedAt` and previous pack events
- **Auto-fix**: When policy allows, automatically adjust regressive timestamps to `lastTimestamp + 1ms`
- **Reporting**: Flag as `'timestamp-regression'` conflict with detailed error message

**Test Coverage**: 4 comprehensive test scenarios

### 🔗 **Orphan Event Detection**

**Problem:** TASK_UPDATED/MOVED/COMPLETED/SNOOZED events that reference task IDs with no prior TASK_CREATED can cause runtime errors.

**Solution:**

- **Tracking**: Maintain set of all task IDs that have been created (existing + pack)
- **Validation**: Check non-CREATE events against this registry
- **ID Remapping**: Correctly track remapped IDs to prevent false orphan detection
- **Reporting**: Flag as `'orphan-event'` conflict with task ID details

**Test Coverage**: 5 comprehensive test scenarios + 2 integration scenarios

## 🏗️ **Implementation Details**

### **Enhanced Conflict Types**

```typescript
// Extended conflict reasons
reason: 'id-conflict' | 'timestamp-regression' | 'orphan-event'

// Added optional details field
details?: string  // Human-readable explanation
```

### **Core Logic Enhancements**

- **Timestamp Tracking**: `Map<taskId, lastTimestamp>` initialized with existing tasks
- **Creation Registry**: `Set<taskId>` tracking all created tasks (existing + pack)
- **ID Remapping Awareness**: Both checks correctly handle remapped IDs
- **Policy Compliance**: Respects `skipExisting` vs auto-fix behavior

### **Zero API Churn**

✅ All existing tests pass without modification  
✅ Backward compatible conflict interface  
✅ Pure planning-phase checks with no apply-time changes  
✅ No breaking changes to existing function signatures

## 📊 **Test Results**

**Total Pack Tests**: 32/32 passing ✅

- Original functionality: 21 tests ✅
- **New hardening features: 11 tests ✅**

**Coverage Areas**:

- ✅ Monotonic timestamp detection and auto-adjustment
- ✅ Regression against existing task timestamps
- ✅ Policy-specific behavior (skip vs auto-fix)
- ✅ Orphan event detection for all event types
- ✅ Referential integrity with ID remapping
- ✅ Combined scenarios with multiple violations
- ✅ Edge cases (equal timestamps, complex event chains)

## 🛡️ **Data Integrity Benefits**

### **Production Safety**

- **Prevents time-travel**: No events can appear before their prerequisites
- **Ensures referential integrity**: All events reference valid, existing tasks
- **Maintains causality**: Event sequences follow logical temporal order
- **Reduces runtime errors**: Catches malformed sparkpacks at planning stage

### **Developer Experience**

- **Clear error reporting**: Detailed conflict descriptions with context
- **Flexible policies**: Choose between strict rejection vs auto-repair
- **Comprehensive validation**: Single planning call catches all integrity issues
- **Debuggable conflicts**: Human-readable details for troubleshooting

## 🎯 **User Request Fulfillment**

✅ **"Monotonic timestamps"** - Reject/auto-adjust timestamp regressions  
✅ **"Orphan guard"** - Flag events with no prior TASK_CREATED  
✅ **"Pure checks in planner"** - No API changes, planning-phase only  
✅ **"No API churn"** - Fully backward compatible implementation

The implementation provides **surgical hardening** that prevents data corruption while maintaining full backward compatibility and comprehensive test coverage.
