## üõ°Ô∏è ANTI-DRIFT PREPEND (v4 Umbrella)

```
ANTI-DRIFT PREPEND ‚Äî GPT DEV PLAN v4

GOAL
- Ship A5 (perf+responsive), add one AI-lite feature behind a flag, and surface BYOS/crypto credibility signals ‚Äî without changing backend, configs, or store shape.

ALLOWED
- src/components/** (new/edits)
- src/App.tsx
- index.css (styling only)
- test/**

FORBIDDEN
- SSOT/docs/configs/deps/backend/crypto changes
- Store shape/enum changes
- Parser/ranking/engine changes
- New dependencies or build config edits

IMMUTABLE CONSTRAINTS
- Preserve A1‚ÄìA4 behaviors (a11y, keyboard, ARCHIVED semantics, search/quick-add wiring).
- DnD remains optional; keyboard + "Move to‚Ä¶" are canonical.
- Any AI is opt-in (feature flag) and reversible. No blocking flows depend on AI.

RELEASE GUARDS (v4 must)
- Perf sampler in dev records LCP/INP/CLS; lane switch shows no CLS spike.
- Mobile: 3‚Üí1 column with tabs; 44px touch targets; reduced-motion respected.
- If scopes UI exists, it passes through to existing engine only; else omit.
- AI-lite suggestions present only when flag on; no parser changes.
- BYOS/crypto surfaced as badges/tooltips (read-only), no new flows.
- All tests green on Chromium/WebKit/Firefox + mobile emulation.
```

## üìã Strategic Decisions (Locked)

### 1. Reality vs. Vision: **Hybrid Approach**

- Complete A5 (performance + responsive) foundation
- Layer one AI-lite feature + credibility signals
- No backend churn, maintain current trajectory

### 2. UI Quality Bar: **Linear-level for task flows**

- Linear-level speed + keyboard shortcuts
- Notion-level richness deferred to later phases
- Professional polish without over-engineering

### 3. Crypto/BYOS: **Enterprise signals with light UI**

- Non-invasive UI badges ("Data location: BYOS", "Verifiable log enabled")
- No new crypto flows or backend changes
- Credibility positioning for enterprise conversations

### 4. AI-Native: **Plan surfaces + one small AI feature**

- Define integration points for future
- Ship "suggest tags/priority" behind feature flag
- Reversible, non-blocking implementation

### 5. Go-to-Market: **Freemium ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Enterprise**

- Start with freemium adoption
- Minimal API hooks for developer engagement
- Enterprise positioning via BYOS + transparency

### 6. 220-LOC Budget: **Implementation depth over breadth**

- Thin slices with hard DoD + comprehensive tests
- Defer anything requiring new deps or configs

## üóìÔ∏è 6-Week Roadmap

### **Week 1-2: A5 Foundation (Performance + Mobile)**

**Performance Monitoring**

- Implement performance sampler in development mode only
- Track LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), INP (Interaction to Next Paint), CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- Ensure lane switching produces no CLS spikes (< 0.1 threshold)
- Add `window.__perf` dev-only global for debugging

**Mobile Responsiveness**

- Collapse 3-column layout to 1-column with tab navigation
- Implement touch-friendly UI (‚â•44px touch targets)
- Add swipe gestures for tab switching
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

**DoD Criteria:**

- [ ] Performance metrics captured in dev mode
- [ ] CLS < 0.1 during lane transitions
- [ ] Mobile layout collapses gracefully
- [ ] Touch targets meet accessibility standards
- [ ] Search and QuickAdd usable on mobile

**Tests Required:**

```
test/e2e/a5-performance-responsiveness.spec.ts
- Performance observer integration
- CLS measurement during lane operations
- Mobile viewport responsive behavior
- Touch target dimension validation
- Reduced motion compliance
```

### **Week 3: A4 Stability + Conditional Search Scopes**

**Search Enhancement (Conditional)**

- IF existing search engine accepts `status/tag/date` parameters
- THEN add UI pass-through filters (no new search logic)
- ELSE skip and maintain v4 schedule

**A4 Hardening**

- Maintain listbox ARIA compliance
- Preserve 150-250ms debounce timing
- Ensure `<mark>` highlights are XSS-safe (escaped content)

**DoD Criteria:**

- [ ] Scope filters pass through to existing engine (if supported)
- [ ] Search highlighting secure against injection
- [ ] Listbox navigation remains accessible
- [ ] Debounce performance maintained

**Tests Required:**

```
test/e2e/a4-search-stability.spec.ts
- Scope filter UI reflects in results (black-box)
- Highlight sanitization (no regex injection)
- ARIA compliance maintained
```

### **Week 4: AI-Lite Suggestions (Feature Flagged)**

**Smart Suggestions Panel**

- "Suggest tags/priority" on task creation
- Non-blocking suggestion panel with "Apply" action
- Updates form fields when accepted
- Live-region announcements for accessibility
- Complete feature flag integration

**Implementation Constraints**

- No changes to existing parser logic
- No new dependencies
- Fully reversible (flag off = no UI)
- Never blocks core task creation flows

**DoD Criteria:**

- [ ] Suggestions appear only when flag enabled
- [ ] Apply button updates form fields correctly
- [ ] Live-region announces suggestions applied
- [ ] Feature completely hidden when flag disabled
- [ ] No impact on core task creation performance

**Tests Required:**

```
test/e2e/ai-suggestions.spec.ts
- Flag on: suggestions present and functional
- Flag off: no AI UI elements visible
- Accessibility: live-region announcements
- Performance: no blocking of core flows
```

### **Week 5: BYOS/Crypto Credibility Signals**

**Sovereignty Indicators**

- Header badge: "Data: BYOS" with explanatory tooltip

- Accessible labels and descriptions
- No new navigation flows or backend integration

**Enterprise Positioning**

- Read-only credibility signals
- Educational tooltips explaining benefits
- Professional visual treatment
- Accessibility compliance

**DoD Criteria:**

- [ ] BYOS badge visible in header with tooltip

- [ ] Tooltips explain sovereignty/transparency benefits

**Tests Required:**

```
test/e2e/credibility-signals.spec.ts
- Badge visibility and accessibility
- Tooltip content and interaction
- Role/label presence for screen readers
```

### **Week 6: Polish + UAT Hardening**

**Final Integration**

- Fix identified paper cuts
- Bundle size optimization
- Documentation finalization
- Test suite stabilization
- Cross-browser validation

**Quality Assurance**

- A/B test DnD vs keyboard/menu (keep DnD as enhancement)
