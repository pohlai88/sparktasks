## üéØ **STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Railway Foundation (Weeks 1-3) - CRITICAL PATH**

#### **Week 1: Architecture Setup**
```bash
# Create Railway layer (preserving all existing code)
mkdir -p src/railway/{stations,conductor,policies,wagons,types,hooks,utils}
mkdir -p src/app/{providers,routes}

# Implementation priority:
1. Base station component architecture
2. PMBOK type definitions  
3. Academic anchor system
4. Station routing integration
```

#### **Week 2: Station Implementation**
```typescript
// Implement 5 core stations using existing components
‚úÖ InitiationStation.tsx    // Composes EnhancedForm + SimpleEditor
‚úÖ PlanningStation.tsx      // Composes SimpleTable + BarChart  
‚úÖ ExecutionStation.tsx     // Composes TaskBoard + DragDrop
‚úÖ HandoverStation.tsx      // Composes FileUpload + Checklist
‚úÖ EvaluationStation.tsx    // Composes KPICards + Retrospective
```

#### **Week 3: Academic Integration**
```typescript
// Add visible PMBOK/ISO credibility
‚úÖ Academic anchor badges in all station headers
‚úÖ Policy violation alerts with academic citations
‚úÖ PMBOK process group navigation
‚úÖ Compliance scoring dashboard
```

**Phase 1 Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 95%+ component reuse (no new basic components)
- [ ] Station switching <100ms
- [ ] Academic anchors visible throughout
- [ ] Zero regressions in existing functionality

### **Phase 2: AI Conductor (Weeks 4-6) - HIGH VALUE**

#### **OpenAI Integration Strategy**
```typescript
interface AIConductor {
  // System-aware orchestration
  orchestrateFlow(context: ProjectContext): Promise<StationRecommendation>;
  
  // Academic grounding
  explainDecision(decision: RoutingDecision): AcademicJustification;
  
  // Enterprise governance
  flagPolicyViolations(action: UserAction): Promise<PolicyAlert[]>;
}
```

**Implementation Priorities**:
1. **Context-aware routing** - AI suggests next station based on project state
2. **Academic justification** - All AI decisions cite PMBOK/ISO standards  
3. **Policy integration** - AI flags governance violations before they occur
4. **Performance optimization** - <2s response time, intelligent caching

### **Phase 3: Enterprise Wagons (Weeks 7-9) - DIFFERENTIATION**

#### **Risk Wagon (ISO 31000)**
- Risk heatmap using existing HeatmapChart component
- Ishikawa diagram for root cause analysis
- Predictive risk scoring with AI integration

#### **Zero-Trust Wagon (Enterprise Security)**
- E2EE implementation with user-controlled keys
- Cryptographic audit trails
- SOC2/GDPR compliance framework

#### **Approval Wagon (Governance)**
- Digital signature integration
- Approval timeline visualization
- Compliance audit reporting

  forbidden_patterns:
    - "className.*bg-[a-z]+-[0-9]+"      # No hardcoded colors
    - "interface.*Basic[A-Z]"             # No basic components
    - "React\.Component"                  # Use existing patterns only
  
  required_patterns:
    - "import.*from '@/components/(ui|data|features)-enhanced" # Must use enhanced
    - "anchor.*PMBOK|ISO.*"               # Academic anchors required
    - "Station.*composes.*Enhanced"       # Composition over creation
```

### **MANDATORY VALIDATIONS**

```typescript
// CI/CD pipeline checks
‚úÖ Component reuse >95%
‚úÖ Academic anchor attribution 100%
‚úÖ Performance budgets maintained
