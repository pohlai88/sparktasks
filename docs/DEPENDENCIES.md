# Dependency Management Policy - SSOT

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-15  
**Review Cadence**: Per-sprint dependency audit

## ðŸŽ¯ **Dependency Hygiene Rules**

### **Add-by-Story Policy**
Every dependency must be:
1. **Referenced in code** - No unused packages in production builds
2. **Owned by feature** - Clear purpose and owner documented
3. **Sprint-scoped** - Added only when implementation begins
4. **Audit-tracked** - Changes reviewed and approved

### **Reintroduction Process (Radix UI Example)**
When adding UI components:

```bash
# 1. Add package
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog

# 2. Create wrapper component - Apply SparkTasks brand tokens
# 3. Verify accessibility - Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
# 4. Document usage - Add to component library
# 5. Update this policy - Record in dependency ledger below
```

## Policy
- Additions require a one-line purpose entry here and an owner (team or person).
- For transient or dev-only tools, document them under a `devDependencies` heading.
- Meta-packages like `@types/*` and `eslint-*` are auto-ignored and don't need documentation.

## How to add a dependency
1. Open a PR that updates `package.json` and adds an entry here explaining the purpose and owner.
2. CI will reject PRs that add dependencies without a corresponding docs entry.
3. Run `npm run validate` locally to check compliance before pushing.
