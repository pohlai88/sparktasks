# 🧬 Surgical Patches: Micro-Enhancements for Witness Co-Signing

## ✅ Implementation Complete - High Impact, Low Effort

**Successfully implemented 3 surgical patches in +20 LOC (190/220 total budget)**

---

## 🎯 Patches Implemented

### 1. 🛡️ **Dedup Guard** (5 LOC impact)
**Problem**: Duplicate signatures from same `(org,id)` could inflate quorum counts
**Solution**: Check existing signatures before adding new ones
```typescript
// Before: Risk of signature duplication
if (!wc.sigs.find(s => s.org === sig.org && s.id === sig.id)) wc.sigs.push(sig);
```
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Prevents quorum manipulation, ensures clean threshold logic

### 2. 🔒 **Monotonicity Check** (3 LOC impact)  
**Problem**: Mixed base/root signatures could create invalid attestation records
**Solution**: Enforce base consistency with metrics tracking
```typescript
if (canonicalize(wc.base) !== canonicalize(base)) { 
  const reason = 'mismatched_base'; 
  metricsHook?.increment('witness.ingest.monotonicity_violation'); 
  throw new Error(reason); 
}
```
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Guarantees record integrity, prevents equivocation attacks

### 3. 📊 **Lightweight Metrics** (12 LOC impact)
**Problem**: Limited operational visibility into witness system health
**Solution**: Strategic metric points with reason tracking
```typescript
metricsHook?.increment('witness.verify.failure', { reason: policyCheck.reason });
metricsHook?.increment('witness.ingest.success');
metricsHook?.increment('witness.ingest.unknown_witness');
```
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Improves ops visibility, enables proactive incident response

## 📊 Metrics Dashboard Ready

### **Ingestion Metrics**
- `witness.ingest.success` - Successful signature ingestion
- `witness.ingest.unknown_witness` - Rejection due to unregistered witness
- `witness.ingest.invalid_witness` - Rejection due to witness status/validity
- `witness.ingest.invalid_signature` - Rejection due to signature verification failure
- `witness.ingest.monotonicity_violation` - Rejection due to mixed base/root

### **Verification Metrics**
- `witness.verify.success` - Successful threshold verification
- `witness.verify.failure` - Failed verification (with reason tags)

### **Policy Violation Reasons**
- `threshold_not_met` - Insufficient valid signatures
- `missing_required_org` - Required organization missing
- `banned_org_present` - Banned organization present

## 🧪 Validation Results

### **Test Coverage**: 16/16 tests passing ✅
- **Core functionality**: 12 existing tests (maintained)
- **Surgical patches**: 4 new tests validating enhancements

### **Key Test Validations**
✅ **Dedup Guard**: Proves duplicate signatures don't inflate counts  
✅ **Monotonicity Check**: Proves mixed base/root rejection works  
✅ **Metrics Tracking**: Proves all operation types generate appropriate metrics  
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Proves metrics work across success/failure scenarios
