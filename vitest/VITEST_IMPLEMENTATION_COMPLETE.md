### Coverage Thresholds (100% Enterprise Standard)

```typescript
coverage: {
  thresholds: {
    'vitest/unit/**': {
      statements: 100, branches: 100, functions: 100, lines: 100
    },
    'vitest/components/**': {
      statements: 95, branches: 90, functions: 95, lines: 95
    },
    'vitest/integration/**': {
      statements: 85, branches: 80, functions: 85, lines: 85
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Budgets

```typescript
export const PERFORMANCE_BUDGETS = {
  COMPONENT_RENDER_TIME: 50, // ms
  INTERACTION_RESPONSE_TIME: 16, // ms (60fps)
  ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT_TIME: 100, // ms
} as const
```

- Tests serve as comprehensive examples of Fortune-500 testing patterns
- Ready for implementation once actual components are created

### 🔄 Integration Test Status

- MSW handlers configured but not executed in current verification
- Integration tests will work once API endpoints are available
- Schemas defined for contract testing compliance
